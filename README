Hi, I'm Ryan. I'm currently self-studying Linear Algebra. After doing multiple REF/RREF problems, I've learned that I understand the procedure, but I'm prone to arithmetic errors. I designed this program to help me find and fix errors. I don't yet know how to make a cool application or GUI so I'm using this instead.
The program contains methods for scaling a row, adding rows together, interchanging rows (reducing the rows), copying a row to a matrix, printing that matrix, and creating an array from a row in the matrix. (I wouldn't need the copy or create array methods if C# allowed you to simply access subarrays inside of a multidimensional array.)
So how do you use this weird tool? You add the values of your matrix into the 2D array in the main method. Then you use the Interchange method to reduce the matrix. You can use the PrintMatrix method at any time to verify your arithemtic. (Ooh, I did implement the PrintMatrix method in a way that resembles an augmented matrix.) All of your work is done by hand inside Main. You only run the program to see the printed result. And the methods are setup for any dimensional matrix (aka 2D arrays with any number of columns and rows).
I don't plan on upgrading this program until I learn how to make console apps/GUIs or have new ideas to implement. [If I sound like I don't know what I'm talking about, it's because I don't. :) ]
